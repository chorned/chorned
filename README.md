### About Me

I'm a Senior Product Leader with a track record of leading globally distributed product teams and launching high-complexity products like blogs, smart stores, and apps.

My specialty is bridging the gap between deep technical implementation and strategic business goals.

* **As Senior PM for Google's official blog**, I led the team that **enabled 70% YoY readership growth** and **cut infrastructure costs by 30%**. We did this by balancing legacy updates with new tech, implementing Google's latest **Generative AI** features (like summarization and advanced text-to-speech) and optimizing SEO.
* **At Spotify**, I co-authored a **successful patent** for a novel way to interact with audio ads.
* **I excel at long-term strategy**, having pushed the product roadmap for a major client from 3 months to 12 months by implementing common-sense Agile and SCRUM practices.
